        About me 
        <li>
            My name is Raed Alkhanbashi. I came to the U.S in 2014 as a student; later on the same year I applied for an asylum. I started working in by the end of 2015 at Portland community college cafeteria. Because I wasn't  in English, I was afraid to work outside the PCC campus. One year later, my language improved, my customer service skills got better, and my confident increased. By the end of 2016 I started working at Starbucks
