            <h3><strong>My name is Raed Alkhanbashi. I was born in 1995. Iâ€™m from Yemen, but I was born and rise in Saudi Arabia. I came to the U.S in 2014 as a student; later on the same year I applied for an asylum. I started working in by the end of 2015 at Portland community college cafeteria. Because I wasn't  in English, I was afraid to work outside the PCC campus. One year later, my language improved, my customer service skills got better, and my confident increased. 
                By the end of 2016 I started working at Starbucks and there when I started losing my fears and hesitation I stayed with for 4 years. Then, Corona started and I was unemployed for about a year and a half. After that, I started working at Apple; great experience it was working at Apple. But then I decided to change my life and leave retail jobs. So I decided to join Epicodus. I have no experience in coding world, but I can and I will learn it.</strong></h3>
